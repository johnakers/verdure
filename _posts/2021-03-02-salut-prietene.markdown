I've decided to make a video game, specifically a very short first person
shooter. This is the first blog post in what is hopefully many to come. I'm a
web developer who enjoys story driven, immserive gameplay. The modern Deus Ex's,
and Dishonored series are some of my recent favorites. Additionally, while I
don't play too many gun-laden FPS games these days... narratively and cinematically,
games like Call of Duty are great for that. And being able to show something even
remotely close to that would be great.

##### Synopsis

Valentin walks out of Verdure BioLabs, and gets in a car with Mihai, who is driving.
Valentin has acquired "The Monkey's Paw". They call Ciprian, their emplyer, and tell
them they're on the way to the airport. Ciprian says their has been a change of plans
and they are to drive south to the port, where Ciprian is. Shortly after departing, they get a call from Yoshi, their technical support, telling them that a "Verdure Response
Team" is pursuing them. A chase ensues, from the downtown of a future Constanța, to
the eight lane highway towards the port. Valentin and Mihai cannot have Verdure
security following them to meet Ciprian and must take them all out but get to
Ciprian as fast as possible.

##### Inspiration

There are a few, mostly film. Tenet, Heat, Advanced Warfare's Lagos level,
Mission Impossible 3, The Saint (1997).

##### Setting

[Constanța, Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constan%C8%9Ba), or something
very similar. Perhaps something slightly more bright and "utopian".

- Downtown, with tall buildings... reminiscent of a larger, major city
- Highway
- Bridge/Tunne akin to [Øresund Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98resund_Bridge)

##### Characters

_Main characters (names subject to change)_

- Valentin, the protagonist
- Mihai, the accomplice
- Yoshi, the technician (voice only)
- Ciprian, the villian
- Florentina, the love interest

_Minor characters_

- Verdure security force
- Civilians

##### Barriers

I want to make this game in Unreal Engine. Unfortunately, I don't have a computer
that can correctly run it, at this point in time. Additoinally, I have limited
experience in 2D game engines, and very little experience in Unity, and no experience
in UE. Getting a computer is not the difficult part but staying on task and
learning what I need to, to adequately develop the game I want to is. There are
a couple story driven elements I want to be able to include (in game cutscenes),
which require learning animating, and most likely some other scripting/coding.
